# Tawanda Ndarama Vaimo Test 


## Overview of Architecture 
Below is a brief overview of the architecture of my project. 


SRC Folder :
1. Folder/ Api 
  1. Countdown.js / this is where I wrote the code for the countdown component on the website. 
  2. Counter.js / this is where I wrote the code for the QTY counter on the website. 
  3. New.js / this is where I wrote most of the code to display information from the api given.


2. Folder / Styles 
    1. Breakpoints.scss / this was a file that I imported to help establish breakpoints to ensure the website was responsive. 
    2. Product.scss / this is where most of my styling was written using SASS 


3. File/ App.js / this is where the whole project was funneled from and is the end point for all the code within. 


The rest follows standard React Architecture with regards to folders and files. 

### Get Code 
You can get the source code without a zip file by cloning the repository on your computer. 
1. In your command line : git clone https://github.com/tndarama/Vaimo-Test.git
2. Install Github on your desktop and in the app select clone repository 
3. Navigate to where the repository was stored in the first step and select the folder " repository URL " 
4. this will give you all the code used. please open the source code in VS Code and use " npm start " to run a developers build of the website. 


#### Summary of Tech Stack 
 
 REACT
 I used React Js to code my website because it offers a lot of flexibility and functions that I am beginning to get a deeper understanding of. Plus it helps 
 that the bried recommended I use this programming language. If I was to change anything it would probably be to use a No-Code website builder since 
 building a website can be done faster. Alas the only problem is that coding in React allows more freedome to define how the website looks. Ultimately I am happy with 
 this coding language. 
 
 SASS 
 If I had to choose a preprocessor to work with I really enjoyed using SASS for this project. Some of the great features are its ability to use variables 
 and to use nested syntax. This makes the styling part of any website much easier. In addition useful extensions on VS Code help to compile it to css 
 so both I and the computer have an easy timing coding and reading the style components. 
 When starting out Tailwinds and Bootstrap were common place for me and I have designed many websites with them so a lot of the habits that I gained from using these
 CSS stacks leak. I am now more confident with preprocessors and I wouldnt change anything in this regard going forward 
 
 *I did install yarn out of habit but never used it in code. 
 
 AXIOS 
 Lastly this was the stack I used to retrieve information from api given. I first learned about retrieving api's with AXIOS so I felt I could use it again here. 
 I wouldnt change anything about using this function. Seeing as retrieving information from an api was a large part of this project I felt confident in using it.
 
 ##### Conclusion 
 This was a really fun test to do and I enjoyed coding it. I look forward to recieving feed back from you and working with you going forward. I know there are still 
 gaps in my technique but I look forward to refining my skills everyday and learning from the awesome developers at VAIMO !
